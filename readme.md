## LaTeX Version of DFG Project template 53_01_en_elan.rtf

This is a LaTeX version of the [DFG](https://www.dfg.de) template for
project proposals within the [SPP 2458 Combinatorial
Synergies](https://combinatorial-synergies.de) created by [Thomas
Kahle](https://www.thomas-kahle.de).  It comes **with no warranty or
responsibility whatsoever**.  When in doubt about proposal formatting
or requirements, always consult with the DFG.

- [Official Documentation](https://www.dfg.de/foerderung/programme/koordinierte_programme/schwerpunktprogramme/formulare_merkblaetter/index.jsp)

- The DFG suggests Arial font which is unavailable in standard LaTeX.
  If you want to stay close to that suggestions, uncomment lines 8 and
  9 in the .tex to activate Helvetica.

- The font size should be at least 11pt with 1.2 line spacing.  This
  should be satisfied with LaTeX's 11pt setting.  For the references
  a minimum font size of 9pt is required.
  
- The finished proposal has a page limit of 17 pages for Sections 1-3
  and an additional 8 pages for the remaining sections.  Proposals are submitted
  through [elan](https://elan.dfg.de)

- There are many sections which are not relevant to all proposals.
  For example Clinician Substitutes cannot be applied for within a
  math project.  Mercator fellows, workshops and Gender equality
  measures are all centrally applied for within an SPP.  Consequently
  these can be removed.  The template stays close to the original rtf.
  
- The proposal uses biblatex.  Include the keyword `vorarbeit` in your
  max. 10 publications to be highlighted in the bibliography.
